            "lecture_text": "The most basic thing about Japanese is the Japanese core sentence. Every Japanese sentence is fundamentally the same. It has the same core. What does it look like? We're going to picture it as a train. Every Japanese sentence has these two elements: A and B. The main carriage and the engine. The engine is what makes the sentence move, what makes it work. The carriage has to be there because without the carriage there's nothing for the engine to move. Those two things are the core of every Japanese sentence. And if you can understand this, you can understand every sentence, no matter how complicated it becomes. Later on we'll have a lot more carriages. We can say more about A; we can say more about B; we can combine logical sentences together to make complex sentences. But every Japanese sentence conforms to this basic type. So, what are A and B? Let's begin by reminding ourselves that in any language whatever there are only two kinds of sentence. And they are A is B sentences and A does B sentences. So an A does B sentence is 'Sakura walks'. An A is B sentence is 'Sakura is Japanese'. And we can put these into the past tense; we can put them in the negative; we can turn them into questions; we can say more about A; we can say more about B. But, ultimately, every sentence boils down to one of these: an A is B or an A does B sentence. So let's look at how we do this in Japanese. In Japanese, if we want to say 'Sakura walks' (A does B: Sakura walks), then A is Sakura, the main carriage, and B is walks, the thing she does, the engine of the sentence. Walk in Japanese is 'aruku'. And we need one more thing to make the core Japanese sentence. And that is the linchpin of every sentence, and it's が (ga). Make friends with ga, it's the center of Japanese grammar. Every Japanese sentence revolves around ga. Part of the reason that Japanese gets so confusing the way it's taught in the textbooks is that they don't properly explain this. In some sentences we're not going to be able to see the ga, but it's always there, and it's always doing the same job. That may sound a little complicated, but it isn't. It's very simple, and I'm going to explain that in the next lesson. For now, let's just stick with the very simplest kind of sentence. So here is ga. It looks like a post with a big hook on it, doesn't it? It links together A and B and turns them into a sentence. So, our core A does B sentence is 'Sakura ga aruku': 'Sakura walks'. Now let's take an A is B sentence: 'Sakura is Japanese', or, as we say, 'Sakura is a Japanese person'. So, A again is Sakura, B is Nihonjin, which means Japanese person, and once again we need ga to link them together. So we're going to picture the A car, the main carriage, with a ga on it, because the main carriage, the subject of the sentence, aways carries a ga, to link it to the engine. So Sakura ga Nihonjin – and we need one more thing. There's one other thing that I want you to make friends with, and that's だ (da). 'Sakura ga Nihonjin da': 'Sakura is a Japanese person'. Now, you may have met this da in its fancy form, desu, but there are very good reasons for learning the plain, simple form first. So we're going to learn da. Now if you look at da, it's like an equals sign boxed off to the left. And this is a perfect mnemonic for what it does, because da tells us that A is B. Why is it boxed off to the left? Because it only works one way. Think about this logically: Sakura ga Nihonjin da – Sakura = Japanese person. But it doesn't work the other way: Japanese people are Sakura – they're not all Sakura. Sakura is a Japanese person, but a Japanese person is not necessarily Sakura. So now we have an A is B sentence and an A does B sentence. There is one more form of the Japanese core sentence, for it has three forms. The third form is when we have a describing word, an adjective. In Japanese, describing words end with い (i), just as they often do in English: happy, sunny, cloudy, silly. In Japanese it's just the same: happy – ureshii; sad – kanashii; blue – aoi. Now, we don't have to learn all these, but we do need to know about Japanese adjectives ending in i because they make the third kind of sentence. So let's take an easy one: pen (that's a nice easy word because it means pen) – 'pen ga akai' – 'pen is red'. Now, you notice that we don't have a da on this sentence. Why is that? Because the i-adjective akai (red) – it doesn't mean red, it means is-red. The da function, the equals function, is built into those i-adjectives. So those are the three forms of Japanese sentence. They all start with the subject of the sentence, they're all connected with ga, and they can end in three ways: with a verb, which will end in u, with the copula, da, or with an i because the last word is an adjective. And now you know the basics of Japanese. And although this is very very basic, you already know some things that the textbooks never teach you, and you have already overcome one of the problems that makes Japanese get so complicated",

            "lecture_text": "Last week, we learned how every Japanese sentence has the same core. The main carriage and the engine.A and B. The thing we are talking about and the thing we are saying about it.And I told you that we can have a lot more carriages as sentences become more complex,but they still always have the same core.Now we are going to look at some of those extra carriages.And the first one we're going to look at is a very mysterious carriage, but it's alsoa very very very important one.Part of the reason that so many people find Japanese confusing, vague and difficult isbecause they are never properly taught about this carriage.What does it look like?Well, I told you before that while every sentence has the same two core elements,you can't always see both of them.You can always see the engine, but sometimes you can't see the main carriage.Why not?When you can't see it, it's because of this.This is the invisible carriage.And while you can't see it, it's always there.And understanding that it's always there is the key to understanding Japanese.So, what is the invisible carriage?In English, the closest equivalent is 'it' .So, let's begin by seeing what 'it' does in English.Let's take this sentence: 'The ball rolled down the hill.When the ball got to the bottom, the ball hit a sharp stone.The ball was punctured and all the air came out of the ball.'Now, would anybody ever say that?Of course they wouldn't, because once we have established what we are talking about,we replace it with 'it'.So we say, 'The ball rolled down the hill.When it got to the bottom, it hit a sharp stone.It was punctured and all the air came out of it.'Now, let's suppose a small child tries to say this and says, 'Ball rolled down hill,got to bottom, hit sharp stone, got punctured, all the air came out.'Now, is that difficult to understand?No, it isn't difficult at all, is it?Because in fact we don't need to use this 'it' marker every time, over and over again.English grammar demands it, but there's no actual communicative need to do it.And Japanese doesn't do it.In place of 'it' – which actually means nothing because it can mean anything.If I say 'it', I may be talking about a flower or about the sky.I may be talking about a tree, or my finger, or the Eiffel Tower or the Andomeda galaxy.'It' in itself doesn't mean anything: you know what 'it' is from context.So, if a small child, or even an adult, comes down to the kitchen at night and someone sees her,she might say, 'Got really hungry.Came for something to eat.'Again, there's nothing confusing or difficult about this.She means, 'I got really hungry.I came down for something to eat.'In English this isn't a proper sentence, but in Japanese it is.All those little pronouns, like 'it', 'she', 'he', 'I', 'they', in Japanese can be replacedby the invisible carriage, the zero pronoun.But the important thing to remember is that they are still there.All right.So let's look at this at work in Japanese.I might say, 'Dolly da', and that means 'I am Dolly'.So the full sentence is, 'zero-ga Dolly da'.So this looks as if it only has an engine and no main carriage,but the main carriage is simply the invisible one.And we can say that 'I' is the default value of the zero pronoun, the invisible carriage.However, the context can define it as anything.For example, if we hear a rustling in the woods and look over in the direction of it,and I say, 'usagi da!' that means 'zero ga usagi da!''It is a rabbit!'It, that thing we just looked toward, rustling in the trees, that's a rabbit.If I say, 'doyoubi da' (doyoubi means Saturday), I'm saying 'It is Saturday'.What's 'it'?Today – 'Today is Saturday' – 'It is Saturday'.All these sentences are full, complete Japanese sentences, with the ga-marked subject,the A carriage, the main carriage, and the engine.But in each of these cases, the main carriage is invisible – but it's still there.Now, it may seem a little bit like splitting hairs to insist that it isn't being left out,it actually is there.But it's important to understand this.It's important at this stage, but it will become much more important as sentences become more complex.Without this piece of information, they're going to start sounding extremely vague and hard to grasp.So now, let's start looking step-by-step at how sentences can become more complex.And then let's see how it all fits together at this stage.I'm going to introduce you to one more kind of carriage and that is an を car.This means a noun marked by the particle を.It is sometimes said 'wo' and more usually just 'o'.And if you know the English grammatical term 'object', which means the thing we're doingsomething to, it's a good mnemonic to remember that 'o' stands for 'object'.So the を car looks like this, and as you see, it's white.It's white because it's not part of the core train.The core train always consists of just two elements, the engine and the main carriage.When we see white cars, we know that they're telling us something more about the engineor about the main carriage.So let's take a sentence here: 'watashi-ga keeki-wo taberu'.This means 'I eat cake'.Now, the core sentence here is 'I eat'.Those are the two black carriages.The white carriage, 'keeki-wo', is telling us more about the engine.The core sentence is 'I eat' and 'keeki-wo' is telling us what it is that I eat.Now, the interesting thing here is that we may often see this said like this: 'keeki-wo taberu'.And I think you already know what's going on when this happens.This is another case where we have the invisible A car.We can't have a sentence without a が.We can't have an action being done without a doer.If we say 'keeki-wo taberu', what we're really saying is 'zero-ga keeki-wo taberu'.And the default value for 'zero', for the invisible carriage, is 'watashi'.So usually this is going to be 'I eat cake', although if you were talking about someoneelse at the time, it might mean that that person eats cake.All right.So this is quite a lot of information to process at one time, and once again,if you'd like to make some sentences using を and using the invisible carriage– and if you do that, I'd like you to write it in three forms, that's to say,the Japanese would be 'keeki-wo taberu';the full form of the Japanese, including the zero pronoun, the invisible carriage, would be 'zero-ga keeki-wo taberu',and the English would be 'I eat cake'.So, if you'd like to practice any of these sentences and write them in the comments below,once again I will correct them while this channel remains small and I'm able to do so.",
